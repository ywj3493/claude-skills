# frontend-planning

6-step planning document pipeline for frontend projects, organized by domain.

## When to Use

- User says "프론트엔드 기획", "frontend planning", "UI 설계", "화면 설계"
- User says "프론트엔드 문서", "기획 문서 만들어줘", "plan frontend"
- Starting a new frontend project that needs structured design documents
- Adding a major frontend feature that requires multi-page planning

## When NOT to Use

- Backend-only projects (use the backend planning pipeline instead)
- Fixing a single component or small UI tweak
- Editing or updating existing specification documents
- Non-UI work such as CI/CD, infrastructure, or tooling

## Pipeline Overview

```text
Step 0:   Tech stack detection
Step 0.5: Domain analysis
Step 1:   Requirements
Step 2:   User Flows
Step 3:   Page Spec
Step 4:   Use Cases
Step 5:   Component Tree
Step 6:   State & API Integration
Step 7:   README (table of contents)
```

For multi-domain projects, Steps 1–6 are completed for each domain before
moving to the next. Step 7 runs once at the end to generate the index.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 0: Detect Tech Stack

Before generating any documents, detect the project's tech stack:

1. Read `package.json` — check for React, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt, Svelte, Angular, etc.
2. Read `tsconfig.json` — check if TypeScript is used
3. Scan directory structure — `src/`, `app/`, `pages/`, `components/`
4. Check for styling solutions — Tailwind, styled-components, CSS Modules, etc.
5. Check for state management — Redux, Zustand, Recoil, Pinia, etc.

Summarize the detected stack and confirm with the user:

> **Detected tech stack:**
> - Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
> - Language: TypeScript
> - Styling: Tailwind CSS
> - State: Zustand
>
> I'll generate planning documents based on this stack. Does this look correct?

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 0.5: Domain Analysis

After confirming the tech stack, identify the project's domain structure:

1. Ask the user to describe the project's major feature areas
2. Propose domain groupings based on their description (e.g., `auth`, `payment`, `dashboard`)
3. Always create at least one domain directory — even single-domain projects use `specifications/<domain>/`
4. Present the proposed directory structure for confirmation:

> **Proposed domain structure:**
>
> ```
> docs/en/specifications/
> ├── auth/
> │   ├── requirements/
> │   └── workflows/
> └── dashboard/
>     ├── requirements/
>     └── workflows/
> ```
>
> I'll generate the 6 planning documents for each domain in sequence.
> Shall I proceed with this structure?

5. Store the confirmed domain list for subsequent steps

Wait for confirmation before proceeding. If the user requests changes to the
domain groupings, adjust and re-confirm.

### Step 1: Requirements

**Output**: `docs/en/specifications/<domain>/requirements/requirements.md`

1. Load the reference template: `references/requirements-template.md`
2. Check `docs/en/specifications/` for existing backend documents — reference them if present
3. Ask the user to describe:
   - Project purpose and target users
   - Core features and functionality
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, accessibility, etc.)
4. Generate the document following the template structure
5. Present the document to the user and wait for review

> **Step 1/6 complete**: Requirements document generated.
> Please review and let me know if any changes are needed. Ready to proceed to the next step?

### Step 2: User Flows

**Output**: `docs/en/specifications/<domain>/workflows/user-flows.md`

1. Load the reference template: `references/user-flows-template.md`
2. Load Step 1 output: `<domain>/requirements/requirements.md`
3. For each major feature, create:
   - **Mermaid flowchart** diagram showing the happy path
   - Alternative paths and error/exception flows
   - Entry and exit conditions
4. Generate the document and wait for review

> **Step 2/6 complete**: User flows document generated.
> Please review and let me know if any changes are needed. Ready to proceed?

### Step 3: Page Spec

**Output**: `docs/en/specifications/<domain>/workflows/page-spec.md`

1. Load the reference template: `references/page-spec-template.md`
2. Load previous outputs: Steps 1–2
3. For each page/screen, define:
   - URL / route path
   - Layout structure and sections
   - Key components on the page
   - Responsive behavior (mobile / tablet / desktop)
   - SEO considerations (title, meta, OG tags)
4. Generate the document and wait for review

> **Step 3/6 complete**: Page specification generated.
> Please review and let me know if any changes are needed. Ready to proceed?

### Step 4: Use Cases

**Output**: `docs/en/specifications/<domain>/workflows/use-cases.md`

1. Load the reference template: `references/use-cases-template.md`
2. Load previous outputs: Steps 1–3
3. For each use case, define:
   - Actor (user role)
   - Preconditions and postconditions
   - Main flow (step-by-step actor-system interaction)
   - Alternative flows
   - Exception flows
4. Generate the document and wait for review

> **Step 4/6 complete**: Use cases document generated.
> Please review and let me know if any changes are needed. Ready to proceed?

### Step 5: Component Tree

**Output**: `docs/en/specifications/<domain>/workflows/component-tree.md`

1. Load the reference template: `references/component-tree-template.md`
2. Load previous outputs: Steps 1–4
3. Define the component hierarchy:
   - **Mermaid graph TD** diagram showing parent-child relationships
   - Separate sections for shared/common components and page-specific components
   - **TypeScript interface** for each component's props
4. Generate the document and wait for review

> **Step 5/6 complete**: Component tree document generated.
> Please review and let me know if any changes are needed. Ready to proceed?

### Step 6: State & API Integration

**Output**: `docs/en/specifications/<domain>/workflows/state-api-integration.md`

1. Load the reference template: `references/state-api-integration-template.md`
2. Load previous outputs: Steps 1–5
3. Check `docs/en/specifications/` for existing backend API specs — reference endpoints if available
4. Define:
   - State management strategy and rationale
   - **TypeScript interface** for each store/slice
   - API endpoints table with method, path, description
   - **TypeScript interface** for request/response DTOs
   - Caching strategy and error handling patterns
5. Generate the document and wait for review

> **Step 6/6 complete**: State & API integration document generated.
> Please review and let me know if any changes are needed.

### Step 7: Generate README

**Output**: `docs/en/specifications/README.md`

After all domains have completed Steps 1–6, generate a table of contents.

For single-domain projects:

```markdown
# Specifications

## Domains

### <domain>

| Document | Path | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Requirements | [requirements.md](<domain>/requirements/requirements.md) | Feature requirements and constraints |
| User Flows | [user-flows.md](<domain>/workflows/user-flows.md) | User interaction flows with Mermaid diagrams |
| Page Spec | [page-spec.md](<domain>/workflows/page-spec.md) | Page layouts, routes, and responsive behavior |
| Use Cases | [use-cases.md](<domain>/workflows/use-cases.md) | Actor-system interactions |
| Component Tree | [component-tree.md](<domain>/workflows/component-tree.md) | Component hierarchy and props |
| State & API | [state-api-integration.md](<domain>/workflows/state-api-integration.md) | State management and API integration |
```

For multi-domain projects, list each domain in a separate section. Also generate
a per-domain `README.md` at `<domain>/README.md` if there are 2+ domains.

If `docs/en/specifications/README.md` already exists, merge the frontend
planning section rather than overwriting.

Report completion:

> **Frontend planning complete.** Generated documents for all domains:
> - `docs/en/specifications/<domain>/requirements/requirements.md`
> - `docs/en/specifications/<domain>/workflows/user-flows.md`
> - `docs/en/specifications/<domain>/workflows/page-spec.md`
> - `docs/en/specifications/<domain>/workflows/use-cases.md`
> - `docs/en/specifications/<domain>/workflows/component-tree.md`
> - `docs/en/specifications/<domain>/workflows/state-api-integration.md`
> - `docs/en/specifications/README.md`

## Document Rules

- **Language**: English
- **Meta block**: Every document includes Created date, Last Modified date, Status (Draft/Review/Final), Tech Stack, and Prerequisites
- **Mermaid**: Use `flowchart TD` for user flows, `graph TD` for component trees
- **TypeScript**: Use `interface` declarations for props, store shapes, and API DTOs
- **References**: Each step must load all previous step outputs before generating
- **Review gate**: Never proceed to the next step without user approval
